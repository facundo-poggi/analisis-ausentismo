# Project 1 – Attendance and Absenteeism Analysis

This project analyzes attendance and absenteeism patterns based on appointment data stored in a CSV file, simulating a real-world healthcare context.

The objective is to extract meaningful metrics that help understand patient attendance behavior and support operational decision-making.

## Features
- Load and process appointment data from a CSV file
- Calculate total appointments, attendances, and absences
- Generate a basic absenteeism report
- Output results in a readable format

## Data
The dataset includes appointment records with attendance status.

The data structure is intentionally simple to focus on logic, data handling, and analysis rather than complex modeling.

## Technologies and Concepts
- Python
- CSV file handling
- Lists and dictionaries
- Control flow and functions
- Basic analytical reasoning

## Project Context
This project was developed as part of a data analysis learning path, with a focus on healthcare-related use cases.
